node version:-  node -v 
Must be > node 12
Installation:-
----------------------

Step 1 - Install Expo CLI
Run the following command in your terminal to install the command line interface (CLI) of Expo:

npm install expo-cli --global

Step 2 :- create project

expo init my-new-project
cd my-new-project
expo start

or npm start

step 3:-Running the App on a Real Device & Debugging:-
------------------------------------------------------
Don't forget, with Expo, you can easily run your app on real devices, too!

Simply download the Expo app from the App Stores and scan the barcode the Expo DevTools 
(that browser tab which opened when you ran npm start) show.

On iOS devices, you don't scan the barcode with the Expo app but instead with your normal device 
camera (simply point it at the barcode and you should be prompted whether you want to open that app in the Expo app).

On Android devices, you find an integrated barcode scanner in the Expo app.
You may have to wait a minute while your project bundles and loads for the first time.

With the app running on a real device, you can debug it from there, too. Shake the device a little to bring up the developer menu.

There, you can enable the remote debugger and the other features covered in this module.

step 4- Simulator and emulator
https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/
->Open Android Studio 
->Configure ->Avd Manager 
->there Set up a virtual device by Pressing the "+ Create Virtual Device" button.

step 5-Debugging on Simulator and emulator
=>Ctrl +M =>Android (A tab will apppear in the browser (if you have started your project) after pressing debug js remotely)
then Look for shortcut i.e Ctrl +Shift +J for developer tools
=>Command +D =>IOS

note:-used npm install --save expo-font(in this project)

Upgrading Your App:-
----------------
Hereâ€™s how to upgrade your app to Expo SDK 35.0.0 from 34.0.0.
Close your Expo CLI server
Run expo upgrade in your project directory (requires the latest version of expo-cli, you can update with npm i -g expo-cli).
Make sure to check the breaking changes section of this post!
Run expo start -c
Update the Expo app on your phones from the App Store / Google Play. expo-cli will automatically update 
your apps in simulators if you delete the existing apps, or you can run expo client:install:ios and expo client:install:android.
If you built a standalone app previously, remember that you will need to create a new build in order 
to update the SDK version. Run expo build:ios and/or expo build:android when you are ready to do a new build for submission to stores.
